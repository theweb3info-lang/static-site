# Andy's Content Automation Playbook

## 🎯 The Goal
One idea → 5 platforms → minimal extra work

## 📊 Viral Content Formulas

### Title Optimization Rules

**🎯 Great Title Checklist:**
1. **Paradox/Contrast** - Create cognitive dissonance
   - ✅ "效率提升 300%，为什么我反而更累了？"
   - ❌ "关于AI时代工作效率的一些思考"
2. **Specificity** - Use concrete numbers
   - ✅ "300%" vs ❌ "大幅"
3. **Length Control**
   - Mobile: ≤20 chars ideal, ≤25 max
   - Desktop: ≤30 chars
4. **Subtitle Pattern** - Main title + explanatory subtitle
   - Format: `核心悖论 —— 深度框架`
   - Example: `效率提升 300%，为什么我反而更累了？—— AI 时代的三重过劳`
5. **Avoid Academic Jargon** - unless your audience is academics
   - ✅ "打工人的AI困境" 
   - ⚠️ "AI时代的三重过劳" (acceptable but less conversational)

**📐 Title Length Guidelines:**
- **WeChat 公众号**: 20-25 chars (mobile preview limit)
- **Toutiao/NetEase**: 15-25 chars (algorithm prefers shorter)
- **Medium**: 30-60 chars (shows full title in feed)
- **X.com**: 50-60 chars (tweet-friendly)

**🔧 Quick Title Tests:**
Before publishing, ask:
1. Does it create curiosity? (Would I click?)
2. Does it promise value? (What will I learn?)
3. Is it mobile-friendly? (Can I read it in 1 glance?)
4. Does it fit my brand? (Expert vs clickbait balance)

**📊 Title Performance Patterns (Andy's audience):**
| Pattern | Open Rate | Share Rate | Example |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Paradox | 8-12% | High | "效率↑ 却更累↑" |
| Number Hook | 6-10% | Medium | "10个AI工具实测" |
| How-to | 5-8% | Low | "如何用AI..." |
| Tech Deep-dive | 5-7% | Low | "深入理解MCP协议" |

### For Written Posts (Blog/Medium/WeChat)

**Hook Patterns That Work:**
1. **Contrast Hook**: "Why X fails but Y works"
   - "同样是 Sonnet 4.5，为何 CLI 工具差距这么大" ← You already do this!
2. **Number Hook**: "N things/tips/mistakes..."
   - "10 个让开发效率提升 10 倍的关键技巧" ← This too!
3. **Curiosity Gap**: "The hidden reason why..."
4. **Controversy**: "Unpopular opinion: X is overrated"
5. **Tutorial Promise**: "How to X in Y minutes (complete guide)"

**Post Structure (AIDA):**
```
A - Attention: Hook in first line (problem/promise)
I - Interest: Why this matters to YOU (the reader)
D - Desire: Show the solution/results
A - Action: Clear next step (try it, follow, subscribe)
```

### For X.com Threads

**Thread Formula:**
```
Tweet 1: Bold claim or surprising fact (this is 80% of success)
Tweet 2-6: Supporting points with examples
Tweet 7: Summary + CTA ("Follow for more AI coding tips")
```

**Hooks that go viral on X:**
- "I spent 100 hours doing X so you don't have to"
- "This one trick changed how I code with AI"
- "Stop doing X. Do Y instead."
- "Hot take: [controversial opinion about AI tools]"
- "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]"

### For Short Videos (B站/抖音/YouTube Shorts)

**Video Formula (60-90 seconds):**
```
0-3s:  HOOK - "Watch me do X in 30 seconds"
3-10s: CONTEXT - Brief problem statement
10-50s: DEMO - Screen recording with voiceover
50-60s: CTA - "Follow for more" / "Link in bio"
```

**Video Hooks:**
- Start mid-action (skip intros)
- "You're doing AI coding wrong"
- "This AI trick saves me 2 hours daily"
- Show the end result FIRST, then how you got there
