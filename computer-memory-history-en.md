# From Mercury Mumbles to Silicon Silence: The Absurd Evolution of Computer Memory

November 4, 1952, 8 PM. CBS television studio was filled with unusual tension. Host Walter Cronkite faced the nation with a freshly printed slip of paper containing a prediction that left everyone incredulous: Eisenhower would defeat Stevenson with overwhelming superiority to win the presidential election.

This prediction came from a computer named UNIVAC I in Philadelphia. Inside that massive machine, 560 mercury tubes were "mumbling" in 104°F heat, each tube containing a 1.5-meter column of mercury storing and processing nationwide voting data in the form of sound waves. With only 5% of votes counted, UNIVAC delivered this "absurd" conclusion.

Cronkite hesitated. All political experts predicted a neck-and-neck election, with Eisenhower winning by a narrow margin at best. He decided not to broadcast this prediction, instead having technicians "adjust" the program to produce a more "reasonable" result.

The final election outcome? Eisenhower won with an overwhelming 83% to 17% victory. UNIVAC's original prediction was almost perfectly accurate.

This was humanity's first glimpse of computer storage and processing power. Supporting it all were those 560 mercury tubes mumbling in the steamy heat—the opening chapter of computer storage technology's absurd yet magnificent evolutionary history.

## Act I: Electronic Phantoms in Mercury Tubes

Philadelphia, 1951. The UNIVAC I machine room was sweltering. Engineers in white coats carefully calibrated 560 mercury delay-line tubes in the 104°F constant temperature environment. These tubes looked like laboratory test tubes, but contained deadly toxic mercury instead of mysterious potions.

Each tube had a piezoelectric crystal at both ends. During operation, electrical pulses were converted to sound waves traveling through mercury at 1,450 meters per second. Engineers nicknamed them "mumble-tubs" because they produced sounds resembling human mumbling. The entire machine room echoed with the mumbling of 560 "electronic souls"—mysterious and eerie.

John Mauchly stood before these tubes, knowing this was an insane solution. Using toxic mercury, at 104°F, relying on sound waves to store information? This sounded like something from science fiction. But in the early 1950s, vacuum tubes were too expensive, magnetic tape too slow—this was the best solution they could conceive.

One mercury tube could store 560 bits; 560 tubes totaled 313,600 bits—about 39KB. Today a phone photo is 3MB, 77 times larger than UNIVAC's entire memory. Yet this 39KB of storage made UNIVAC the world's focus on election night 1952.

More absurdly, Alan Turing once suggested using gin instead of mercury as the delay medium, claiming gin had "suitable acoustic properties." While obviously tinged with British humor, this reflected the era's engineering spirit—to store a few thousand bits, they'd try any conceivable solution.

## Act II: Time Artists in the Drum Beat

If mercury tube mumbling was the "prehistoric era" of storage technology, then the rotation of magnetic drums was the "classical age" overture. Imagine a metal cylinder 60cm in diameter and 1 meter long, surface coated with reddish-brown magnetic oxide, spinning continuously at 3,600 RPM. This was the "heart" of IBM 650—the magnetic drum memory.

1954, an IBM headquarters office in New York. Programmer John Backus (who later invented FORTRAN) was writing programs for IBM 650. Before him lay a complex circular chart marking timing data for every position on the drum surface. Like ancient astrologers, he needed to precisely calculate each instruction's execution time, then place the next instruction at a carefully calculated position on the drum surface.

This technique called "skip factor" was computer history's earliest performance optimization. Programmers had to deeply understand hardware's physical characteristics, calculating timing like clockmakers. Miscalculations meant waiting for another drum revolution—a full 16.7 milliseconds, an eternity when CPU instructions took only dozens of microseconds.

Backus later recalled: "We were time artists, weaving instruction dances on the rotating drum. Every programmer had to be half physicist, understanding magnetism, rotation speed, and electromagnetic induction's complex relationships."

IBM 650's drum could store 2,000 10-digit words, later increased to 4,000—roughly 35KB total. Today this couldn't fit a single emoji pack, but in 1954 it was "massive storage." More importantly, this optimization thinking persists today: modern CPU caches, instruction pipelines, and branch prediction all trace back to programmers calculating timing on drums.

## Act III: The Weaving Miracle on the Moon

July 20, 1969. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon's surface, Apollo 11's navigation system was supported by a computer with only 72KB memory. Where was this 72KB stored? In thousands of iron rings just millimeters in diameter, hand-woven by Earth-bound women workers using magnifying glasses and copper wire finer than silk.

1965, Raytheon Company factory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A group of women called "LOL" (Little Old Ladies) were performing humanity's most precise handicraft. They sat at workbenches wearing thick magnifying glasses, holding copper wire finer than hair, weaving Apollo guidance computer's core rope memory.

Every wire's path strictly followed program design: to store "1" at an address, copper wire must thread through the corresponding magnetic core; to store "0", wire must bypass the core. One module contained thousands of cores, requiring weeks of continuous work to complete. Critically, no errors were allowed—these memory units would operate 380,000 kilometers from Earth in space, with no repair possibility.

Dorothy Doyle was among these weavers. She later recalled: "We knew every wire we wove might determine astronauts' life or death. Sometimes I'd think, this stitch might be the key to Armstrong's safe return to Earth."

Apollo guidance computer storage capacity seems trivial today: 72KB total memory, insufficient for 1% of an MP3 song. Yet this 72KB guided humanity's greatest adventure. In a sense, human moon landing succeeded not just through rockets and astronauts, but through Earth's anonymous weaving women's exquisite craftsmanship.

More interestingly, when Apollo 11 landed, the computer issued 1202 and 1201 alarms—memory shortage warnings. Even in humanity's greatest moment, we were still troubled by storage capacity limits.

## Act IV: Invisible Memory in Display Screens

June 21, 1948, 11 AM. A Manchester University laboratory in England. Tom Kilburn and Freddie Williams tensely stared at a cathode ray tube display. This display was special—it wasn't for showing images, but for storing data.

On the display screen, countless small light dots were scattered. Each dot represented one bit of information: charged positions were "1", uncharged positions were "0". This was the Williams Tube—the world's first random-access memory.

Kilburn input a 17-line program to calculate 2's highest power. The program began running, screen dots constantly flickering and changing. After 52 minutes, the program stopped, displaying results on screen. This was computer history's first successful stored program execution.

Williams Tube's working principle was miraculous: when electron beams struck phosphor, they produced secondary electron emission, forming a positively charged pit with surrounding negatively charged regions on the phosphor surface. This charge distribution could persist briefly, perfectly representing one bit. But this meant every read destroyed original data, requiring immediate rewrite.

This "destructive read" characteristic drove programmers crazy. UNIVAC 1103 programmers often joked: "Our memory has memory but is very forgetful. Every time we ask a question, it answers then forgets what it just said."

Worse, Williams Tubes were extremely sensitive to electromagnetic interference. Someone turning on lights, closing doors, or even walking nearby could affect stored data. Manchester University engineers joked their computer had "moods"—it made more errors during bad weather.

## Act V: The Paper Kingdom of Programs

Washington D.C., 1890. The US Census Bureau faced a huge challenge: how to process 63 million people's statistical data? Manual counting would require 13 years; by completion time, the next census would begin.

Herman Hollerith proposed a revolutionary solution: record information on punch cards, use mechanical equipment for reading and statistics. Each card had 960 possible punch positions in 12 rows and 80 columns, with each position's presence or absence representing different information.

From the 1950s to 1970s, global data processing was built on these paper pieces. Programmers' work scenes looked like this: offices piled with thousands of cards in different boxes, each labeled: "Payroll Program - Part 1", "Inventory Management - Update Module".

IBM mainframe era programmers recalled that time with mixed emotions. On one hand, physical programming experience had unique charm—you could truly "hold" a program, see code's "weight"; a large system might require several people to lift.

On the other hand, it was an era full of accidents. IBM veteran programmer John Smith recalled: "I'll never forget spring 1967, when my three-month accounting program scattered in final testing due to wind blowing cards everywhere. 5,000 cards scattered on the floor; reassembling them in correct order took two days. Since then, I never work in offices with open windows."

The famous warning printed on cards "Do not fold, spindle or mutilate" became an entire generation of programmers' collective memory. This phrase was later used by rebellious students as protest slogans, becoming symbolic resistance to mechanized society.

## Act VI: The Future Dream's Bubble Burst

1970, Bell Laboratories. Andrew Bobeck stood before a microscope, excitedly observing a magical phenomenon: in certain special magnetic materials, stable tiny magnetic domains—magnetic bubbles could form. These "bubbles" just micrometers in diameter could move under magnetic field control, each storing one bit of information.

Bobeck believed this would completely transform computer storage technology. Magnetic bubble memory had no mechanical moving parts, wasn't afraid of vibration; data wouldn't disappear after power loss; and theoretically could be made extremely compact. Intel, Texas Instruments, and other tech giants invested huge funds, believing magnetic bubble memory would soon replace disks as computers' main storage device.

1978, Intel released 7110 magnetic bubble memory chip, 1 megabit capacity—considerable for that time. Advertising was full of ambition: "Magnetic Bubble Memory—The Future is Here!"

However, history sometimes unfolds dramatically. Just as magnetic bubble memory seemed promising, another technology quietly emerged: Flash Memory. In 1980, Toshiba's Fujio Masuoka invented flash memory technology. This floating-gate transistor-based storage technology not only had all magnetic bubble memory's advantages, but was also lower cost, higher capacity, and faster access speed.

By the 1990s, magnetic bubble memory rapidly fell from "future technology" to historical artifact. Companies that invested tens of millions could only watch their "bubbles" burst.

This story reminds us: technology development paths are never accurately predictable. Today's seemingly unstoppable technology trends might be overturned tomorrow by completely different solutions.

## Act VII: Revolution from Mumbles to Silence

2000, a Samsung Electronics laboratory in Korea. Engineers were testing a new storage device: Solid State Drive (SSD). Unlike traditional hard drives, this device had no mechanical moving parts—no motor humming, no head clicking—silent as the deep sea.

From UNIVAC I's mercury tube mumbling to magnetic drum rotation sounds to mechanical hard drive humming, computer storage devices always accompanied various sounds. Programmers could even judge device working status by sound: dense disk access urgent rhythms, orderly startup sequences, even detecting impending hard drive failure's abnormal sounds.

But SSD changed everything. It worked silent as air, yet provided 100 times faster access speed than mechanical hard drives. A modern 1TB SSD equals 2.68 million UNIVAC mercury tubes, but only phone-sized, weighing less than 100 grams.

More amazing comparison: UNIVAC I's 560 mercury tubes stored 39KB total, requiring room-sized space and 30-ton equipment support; today's microSD card can store 1TB data—equivalent to 25.6 million UNIVAC's entire storage capacity—but only fingernail-sized, weighing less than 1 gram.

This is technological progress power: today's casually phone-inserted storage cards are 25 million times more powerful than the supercomputer that predicted 1952 US presidential election results.

## Finale: The Eternal "Absurd" Cycle

Standing in 2024, we easily mock 1950s "absurd" technical solutions: using toxic mercury for data storage? Having women workers hand-weave computer memory? Using displays as storage? These indeed sound like science fiction plots.

But if we fast-forward 50 years, 2074 people reviewing our today's technology might have similar feelings:

"Can you believe 2024 people actually used 14-nanometer lithography technology to carve circuits on silicon wafers? That's like using elephant feet to write on rice grains! Their memory needed constant refreshing to maintain data, like an old man with amnesia! Most incredibly, they used extreme ultraviolet light and complex chemical processes to manufacture chips, while we now just have AI directly assemble storage devices at molecular level!"

Maybe our today's proud DDR5 memory, PCIe 5.0 SSDs, 3D NAND flash memory are "mercury delay-line storage" modern versions in future people's eyes. Our currently exploring DNA storage, quantum storage, photon storage technologies might be the next "absurd" cycle's starting points.

## Unchanging Creativity

But in this eternal technological cycle, one thing never changes: human creativity under constraints.

When transistors were still in Bell Labs' classified cabinets, UNIVAC engineers achieved electronic storage with mercury tubes; when integrated circuits were still laboratory concepts, Apollo project women workers hand-wove the most reliable storage; when semiconductor processes were immature, programmers built entire data processing eras with paper pieces and mechanical equipment.

Behind every seemingly "absurd" technical solution were smart engineers making rational choices under existing conditions. They might not have predicted their technology being replaced by successors, but their efforts and exploration paved roads for subsequent technological breakthroughs.

1952 UNIVAC engineer John Mauchly predicted Eisenhower's victory amid mercury tubes' mumbling; 1965 Raytheon worker Dorothy Doyle wove lunar navigation systems with delicate hands; 1948 Tom Kilburn achieved the first stored program with flickering fluorescent screens...

They were all era's "absurd" creators and history's true heroes.

## Tomorrow's "Mercury Tubes"

Today, when we easily store dozens of TB data in clouds, watch 4K videos on phones, run complex AI models on laptops, we easily forget this all's origin—those mercury tubes mumbling in hot machine rooms, copper wires in workers' hands, paper boxes programmers carried.

But history tells us: today's common sense was yesterday's "absurdity." Those technical stories we now find incredible are humanity's wisdom and creativity's most vivid portrayals.

50 years from now, perhaps quantum computers, DNA storage, photon chips will be commonplace. Then, people reviewing our today's technology might say: "2024 people were interesting—they actually used electrons in silicon wafers to store information!"

But regardless of technological changes, one thing never goes out of style: human courage facing the unknown, creativity under constraints, and never-satisfied exploration spirit.

From mercury mumbles to SSD silence, from hand-weaving to lithography—this technological evolution road is tortuous yet magnificent. Every generation of technologists are participants and witnesses of this eternal story.

And our story continues...

In some future late night, perhaps an engineer is debugging some "absurd" new technology in a laboratory, just like 1951 pioneers working before mercury tubes. They don't know how their work will change the world, just as Mauchly didn't know his mercury tubes would predict US presidential election results.

But they all know one thing: today's impossible might be tomorrow's common sense.
