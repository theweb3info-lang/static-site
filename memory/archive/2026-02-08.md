## Key Decisions & Changes

### Cost Optimization (major theme today)
- Switched all 6 group chats to **Sonnet 4.5** (was Opus) — ~5x cheaper on input
- Reduced heartbeat system reports to **every 1 hour** (was ~30min)
- Removed **Discord** entirely — config removed from gateway, 2 cron jobs disabled (Elon tracker, Trump daily)
- Identified biggest token burners: group chat context re-reads (152k g-zygote, 142k g-ideas)
- Andy wants **token usage reported after every reply** across all channels

### Rules Added to AGENTS.md
- **Chinese Input Rule**: If Andy speaks Chinese → reply 收到 → translate to English (IELTS 8.0+ level) → execute
- **Token Usage Reporting**: Show full breakdown after every reply (input/output/cache-read/cache-write/cost)
- Both rules apply to ALL channels (DMs, groups, everywhere)

### Cron Schedule Rearranged
- All jobs spaced 1 hour apart to avoid concurrency
- Tonight: Medium AI 21:00, 明治人物研究 22:30, Ideas Collector 23:00
- Tomorrow: Elon daily 07:00, Trump (disabled), Medium AI 09:00/21:00, Ideas 23:00
- All cron jobs timeout set to **600 seconds** (was default/too short)
- Elon tracker + Trump daily → **disabled** (Discord removed)

### Infrastructure
- Installed **htop** (`brew install htop`)
- Discovered Claude Desktop VM eating 398% CPU — killed it, load dropped from 5.0 to 1.0
- VM was from Claude Desktop's "cowork" feature (Virtualization.framework + gVisor)

### Browser Setup
- Installed **OpenClaw Browser Relay** Chrome extension (local, not from web store)
- OpenClaw browser control service not working after config change
- Set up **Playwright MCP** via mcporter — `--extension` mode with token auth
- Token: configured in mcporter with PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN
- Can now browse Andy's actual Chrome with logged-in sessions
- Added Claude.ai usage check to HEARTBEAT.md (via Playwright MCP)

### Static File Hosting
- Updated TOOLS.md: public assets go to `https://theweb3info-lang.github.io/static-site/`
- Markdown images also hosted there via HTTPS URLs
- Repo: `theweb3info-lang/static-site` (already cloned in workspace)

### Claude CLI
- Path: /opt/homebrew/bin/claude, v2.1.34
- Use for complex/generation tasks to offload from main session
- Separate rate limit from API key — good for avoiding 429s
- Tested: got killed by rate limit when generating infographic HTML

### Infographic Generated
- Topic: "Telegram 群聊背后的 AI 秘密 — OpenClaw Session 机制全揭秘"
- Generated HTML directly (Claude CLI failed due to rate limit)
- Rendered via html2image.js → 4.76 MB PNG
- Emailed to andytest919@gmail.com via himalaya
- Created render-and-send.sh script for future use

### Content Discussion
- Andy asked about 小宇宙 (Xiaoyuzhou) podcast monetization
- Covered: paid subscriptions, brand sponsorship, knowledge付费引流, e-commerce, livestream tips, platform incentives, cross-platform distribution

## Claude.ai Usage (as of 22:43 SGT)
- Plan: Andy Max
- Current session: 29% used, resets in ~4hr
- Weekly all models: 63% used, resets Thu 11PM
- Weekly Sonnet only: 5% used, resets Sat 6PM
- Extra usage: $0/$50 balance

## System Health
- Mac mini up 3 days
- Load stable ~1.3-1.5 after killing Claude Desktop VM
- RAM: 17G used / 6.3G free
- SSD: 26°C, 114Gi/460Gi (27%)
- Hit API rate limit (429) around 17:09 — multiple sessions competing
